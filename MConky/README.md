# MConky
Just Another Desktop Conky

	this conky is based on "Ring Meters by londonali1010"

Setup:
  
  0- If you already have any conky please backup your ".conkyrc" file and ".conky" folder 
  	(both of them should be located on your home directory).
 
 	1- Copy and Paste ".conkyrc" file to your home directory.
	
	2- Copy "MConky" folder and paste it in ".conky" folder.
	
	3- Modify line 44 in ".conkyrc" file and line 358 in ".lua.lua" file(located inside MConky) to point to correct pathes.

	4- Optional: change desktop pic and also "conky.png" can be modified.
 	 
 	5- start conky by typing "conky" in terminal.
 	
 	I made all lines to show some datas, even ones seem to be for decoring are bounded with battery percentage
 	So if they don't appear in your setup bound them with other stuff or just make another lua file to draw them for you...
  
  OK
